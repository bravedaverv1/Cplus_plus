C++ projects are better done when in vs code you only have your porjct folder open
given that when you compile the file, additionial files are created
and a .vsocde folder that contains that compiled code is created and it is sent directly
to the parent folder and not the project folder you have open. being directly in
your project folder only prevents that issue

To Start Running C++ Code, Go To The Extensions Tab
and Download C/C++ Extension Pack & Helpful but not necessary: Code Runner 

create a .cpp file (C++ file)

write a valid program:
    #include <iostream>

    int main(){
        std:: cout <<:"Hello World.
        return 0;
    }

the goal is then to be able to complile that file
in project folder, run g++. if it shows the below, you 
are ready for the next step:
clang++: error: no input files

** g++ is the c++ compiler. if you type in g++
and you do not have it installed, you can install the 
xcode developer tool. in terminal, run:
xcode-select --install

on project file, select settings and have it set to
C/C++: g++ build and debug active file
then press the play button if still needed if not done 
by clicking the above option which will build or compile the code.

from vs terminal you can run the compiled version using, inside your project folder, 
./file-name(excluding .cpp) and pressing enter.
the output should display in the terminal.
the also is also displayed in the debug console

** any changes made to this file, you need to press the to building
or compile the code. 
and then you can run by using the file name

CODE RUNNER EXTENSION:
Allows you to run your code by  selecting on the down options button
found to the right of the play button and select run code. 
using run code allows you to compile AND display the output

** for it to run in vs terminal as well when you click run code
you may  need to configure your code runner extension by going to its settings
and assuring Code-runner run in terminal is seleted as well.
