create a .cpp file (C++ file)

write a valid program:
    #include <iostream>

    int main(){
        std:: cout <<:"Hello World.
        return 0;
    }

the goal is then to be able to complile that file
in project folder, run g++. if it shows the below, you 
are ready for the next step:
clang++: error: no input files

** g++ is the c++ compiler. if you type in g++
and you do not have it installed, you can install the 
xcode developer tool. in terminal, run:
xcode-select --install

on project file, select settings and have it set to
C/C++: g++ build and debug active file
then press the play button if still needed if not done 
by clicking the above option which will build or compile the code.

from vs terminal you can run the compiled version using, inside your project folder, 
./file-name(excluding .cpp) and pressing enter
