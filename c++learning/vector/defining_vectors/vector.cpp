#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
// ? vector , what is it?
// In C++, a vector is a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) 
// that acts as a dynamic array. It can grow or shrink in size as needed, 
// making it a flexible alternative to regular arrays.

// ? vector key features, what are they?
// 1. Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, vectors can change their size 
// automatically when elements are added or removed.
// 2. Easy to Use: Provides built-in functions like push_back to add elements 
// and size to check the number of elements.
// 3. Included in <vector>: To use vectors, include the <vector> library.

// * to use vector we must include it.

int main() {

  std::vector<double> subway_adult;
  // ? vector , how to define it ?
  // vector 
  // followed by the data type in arrows
  // followed by the vector name

  // ? PROMPT
  // The Tokyo Subway has different payment options for adults and children. 
  // We have declared a double vector already named subway_adult.
  std::vector<double> subway_child;
