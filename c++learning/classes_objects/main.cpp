// ? classes , what are they?
// classes can be thought of as a custom data type.
// A C++ class is a user-defined type.
// * The class serves as a blueprint for objects, 
// which are instances of the class (just like age is an instance of int). 
// An object gets characteristics and behaviors from its class.
// * We can create an empty C++ class in the header file.
