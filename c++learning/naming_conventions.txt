C++ Naming Conventions
There is no right or wrong on how you wish to address variables. Different teams prefer different conventions

int file_size; Snake Case - lower case variables to name your variables and constants.

int FileSize; Pascal Case - capitalize the first letter of every variable.

int fileSize; - Camel Case.
