1.11 How To: Describing an Algorithm with Pseudocode

Before you are ready to write a program in C++, you need to develop an 
algorithm—a method for arriving at a solution for a particular problem. 
Describe the algorithm in pseudocode––a sequence of precise steps 
formulated in English. To illustrate, we’ll devise an algorithm for this 
problem:

Problem Statement: 
You have the choice of buying one of two cars. 
One is more fuel efficient than the other, but also more expensive. 
You know the price and fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon, mpg) of both cars. 
You plan to keep the car for ten years. 
Assume a price of $4 per gallon of gas and usage of 15,000 miles per year. 
You will pay cash for the car and not worry about financing costs. 
Which car is the better deal?

Step 1 Determine the inputs and outputs.
In our sample problem, we have these inputs:
purchase price1 and fuel efficiency1, the price and fuel efficiency (in mpg) of the first car
purchase price2 and fuel efficiency2, the price and fuel efficiency (in mpg) of the second car

We simply want to know which car is the better buy. That is the desired output.

Step 2 Break down the problem into smaller tasks.

For each car, we need to know the total cost of driving it. 
Let’s do this computation separately for each car. Once we have the total cost for 
each car, we can decide which car is the better deal.

    The total cost for each car is purchase price + operating cost.

We assume a constant usage and gas price for ten years, so the operating cost depends 
on the cost of driving the car for one year.

    The operating cost is 10 x annual fuel cost.
    The annual fuel cost is price per gallon x annual fuel consumed.

The annual fuel consumed is annual miles driven / fuel efficiency. 
For example, if you drive the car for 15,000 miles and the fuel efficiency is 
15 miles/gallon, the car consumes 1,000 gallons.

Step 3 Describe each subtask in pseudocode.

In your description, arrange the steps so that any intermediate values are 
computed before they are needed in other computations. For example, list the 
step
total cost = purchase price + operating cost
after you have computed operating cost.

Here is the algorithm for deciding which car to buy:
    For each car, compute the total cost as follows: 
    annual fuel consumed = annual miles driven / fuel efficiency
    annual fuel cost = price per gallon x annual fuel consumed
    operating cost = 10 x annual fuel cost
    total cost = purchase price + operating cost
    If total cost of car1 < total cost of car2
        Choose car1.
    Else
        Choose car2.

Step 4 Test your pseudocode by working a problem.
We will use these sample values:
    Car 1: $25,000, 50 miles/gallon
    Car 2: $20,000, 30 miles/gallon
Here is the calculation for the cost of the first car:
annual fuel consumed = annual miles driven / fuel efficiency = 15000 / 50 = 300
annual fuel cost = price per gallon x annual fuel consumed = 4 x 300 = 1200
operating cost = 10 x annual fuel cost = 10 x 1200 = 12000
total cost = purchase price + operating cost = 25000 + 12000 = 37000

Similarly, the total cost for the second car is $40,000. Therefore, the output of the algorithm is to choose car 1.
