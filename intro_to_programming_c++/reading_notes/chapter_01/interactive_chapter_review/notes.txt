Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
    by Robert Frost

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
                   
int main()
{
   cout << "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --" << endl;

   cout << "And that has made all the difference." << endl; 
   cout << "    by Robert Frost" << endl;
   return 0;
}

1.14.2: Fix the program so that it prints out 'C++' in a box.
Fix this program so that it prints out "C++" in a box formed with asterisks, 
like this:

  cout << "********" << endl;
  cout << "*      *" << endl;
  cout << "* C++ *" << endl;
  cout << "*    *" << endl;
   return 0;
}

to:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Fix this code

int main(){
  cout << "*******" << endl;
  cout << "*     *" << endl;
