1.5 Computing and Society: Standards Organizations

Two standards organizations have jointly developed the definitive standard for the C++ language.
American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

The ANSI and ISO standards organizations are associations of industry professionals who
develop standards for everything from car tires and credit card shapes to programming languages.


Why have standards? 
You encounter the benefits of standardization every day. 
When you buy a light bulb, you can be assured that it fits in the 
socket without having to measure the socket at home and the bulb 
in the store. In fact, you may have experienced how painful the lack 
of standards can be if you have ever purchased a flashlight with 
nonstandard bulbs. Replacement bulbs for such a flashlight can be 
difficult and expensive to obtain.

***Having a standard for a programming language such as C++ means that 
you can take a program that you developed on one system with one 
manufacturerâ€™s compiler to a different system and be assured that it 
will continue to work.
